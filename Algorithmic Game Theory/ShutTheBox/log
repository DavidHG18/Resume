9/21  4:00pm   3:15  read through assignment and completed most of the 
                     basic requirements. Reached a non-optimal solution
                     for Player 2's optimal move / expected wins.
9/21  8:30pm   0:15  implemented dynamic programming solution for Player 2.
9/22  2:00pm   2:00  tested solution for Player 1 and found out that
                     there were slight differences between my expected outcomes
                     and the probabilities my program was outputting. began work 
                     on debugging.
9/23  12:45pm  0:30  fixed issues with Player 2 output, formatted rest of output
                     correctly, finished assignment.

I found this assignment to be much easier than the first assignment. I believe this is 
directly related to the fact that I had very little experience in Python prior to starting this 
course, and now I feel much more comfortable attacking a problem without any starting code. I 
took a very long time to debug my code when it wasn't working, however, and want to get better 
at that. I'd love to hear any advice along the lines of debugging in order to further streamline 
the efficiency of this process, as the actual issue in my code happened to be very small but it took 
me two hours to find it.
